<h1 id='send'>Send</h1>
<p>The Send screen lets you send CHI to other people at their CHI addresses.</p>

<p>NOTE: The Send screen is not for transferring names.</p>

<p><img src="/images/img/send-screen.zoom52.png" alt="send-screen" /></p>

<p>To send CHI to another CHI address:</p>

<ol>
<li><p>Paste the address into the Pay to Address input. (Do not type addresses.)</p></li>
<li><p>Enter how much CHI you want to send into the Amount Value input.</p></li>
<li><p>Optionally, you can choose to enter the amount in CHI, mCHI or uCHI. (Using 
the default CHI is recommended.)</p></li>
<li><p>Check whether or not fees should be subtracted from the amount you are 
sending.</p></li>
<li><p>Optionally, you can enter a comment, e.g. &quot;Sending 5 CHI to Alice&quot;.</p></li>
<li><p>Click SEND.</p></li>
</ol>

<p>You can check your transaction on the <a href="transactions.md">Transactions screen</a>.</p>

<p>DO NOT TYPE ADDRESSES.</p>

<p>Typing address is highly discouraged. You could make a simple mistake, and lose 
your CHI.</p>

<p>We STRONGLY recommend copying and pasting addresses.</p>
