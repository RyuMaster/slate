<h1 id='my-names'>My Names</h1>
<p>The My Names screen lists all of the names that you&#39;ve reserved for yourself. 
The following example has 1 name, but you could have many more.</p>

<p>There are 4 columns:</p>

<p>• XAYA Name: This is the proper name that you&#39;ve reserved.</p>

<p>• Name Value (optional): This is simply the JSON expression of your name.</p>

<p>• Address: This is the CHI address for your name.</p>

<p>• Update/Transfer: This allows you to change the properties of your name or to 
transfer your name (account) to someone else.</p>

<p>Unless you fully understand what an update is, you should NOT update your name. 
Updating names is an advanced feature meant for experts.</p>

<p>Transferring a Name</p>

<p>You can transfer a name to someone else by sending the name to a valid CHI 
address.</p>

<ol>
<li><p>Click TRANSFER for the name you wish to transfer.</p></li>
<li><p>Paste in the CHI address that you want to transfer the name to.<br>
 <br>

 </p></li>
<li><p>Click OK.</p></li>
</ol>

<p>The name is transferred to the address. You can check the transaction on the 
<a href="transactions.md">Transactions screen</a>.</p>
