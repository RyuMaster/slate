<h1 id='settings'>Settings</h1>
<p>The Settings screen lets you change connection settings, back up your wallets, 
and switch to testnet.</p>

<p><img src="/images/img/advanced-connection-settings.png" alt="advanced-connection-settings" /></p>

<p>Unless you fully understand the connection settings, you should leave them as 
is.</p>

<p>Advanced users and miners can make the changes they need, then click the SUBMIT 
SETTINGS button to save their new connection settings.</p>

<p>The DataDir Override allows you to change the directory where the XAYA 
blockchain, wallets, and other data is stored. The default directory is:</p>

<p>%APPDATA%\Xaya\</p>

<p>e.g. C:\Users\<user>\AppData\Roaming\Xaya</p>

<p>On Linux the datadir is here:</p>

<p>~/.xaya/</p>

<p>Or here:</p>

<p>~/home/<user>/xaya/</p>

<p>On OS X (Mac) the datadir is here:</p>

<p>~/Library/Application Support/Xaya/</p>

<p>People with limited space on their system drive may wish to change the datadir 
folder location.</p>

<h2 id='testnet'>Testnet</h2>
<p>To switch to testnet, check the Testnet checkbox then click the SUBMIT SETTINGS 
button and restart the XAYA Electron wallet.</p>

<p>Testnet is used for testing. Most people have no need for testnet.</p>

<p>However, if you wish, you can use testnet to try out different features and 
become familiar with them before you &quot;go live&quot; and try them on mainnet.</p>
