<h1 id='network-info'>Network Info</h1>
<p>The Network Info area displays basic information about the blockchain.</p>

<p><img src="/images/img/network-info.png" alt="network-info" /></p>

<p>Connections shows how many active connections you have to other XAYA nodes 
around the world.</p>

<p>Net Type tells you whether you are on mainnet (this is where you play games) or 
on testnet (this is where testing is done).</p>

<p>Is Pruned? tells you whether you&#39;re running with the full blockchain (false) or 
with a shorter version (true).</p>

<p>Median Time is just the time. It updates periodically, and not in real time.</p>
