<p>Block Progression</p>

<p>The Block Progression area shows you the latest block that you&#39;ve downloaded 
from the network, and the current block height. If they are equal, your wallet 
is synchronised with the network.</p>

<p>If you cannot get your wallet to synchronise properly, visit the <a href="https://forum.xaya.io/">XAYA 
forums</a> and post in the <a href="https://forum.xaya.io/forum/16-support/">Support 
forum</a>.</p>
