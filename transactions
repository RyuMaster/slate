<h1 id='transactions'>Transactions</h1>
<p>The Transactions screen has a complete record of your transaction history.</p>

<p>The relevant fields are:</p>

<p>• Address: The address in your wallet involved in the transaction.</p>

<p>• Name/Label: If the transaction was for a name, then relevant name information 
is displayed here. Often these are game moves.</p>

<p>• Category: This tells you whether you sent or received CHI, as well as whether 
the coins are generated (mined).</p>

<p>• Amount: This is the amount of CHI. Sent CHI are negative, and received CHI are 
positive.</p>

<p>• Date: This is the date and time of the transaction in YYYY-MM-DD HH:MM:SS 
format.</p>

<p>• Confirmations: This is the number of confirmations for the transaction. 
Loosely speaking, this is how many blocks have been mined since then.</p>
