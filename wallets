<h1 id='wallets'>Wallets</h1>
<p>The XAYA Electron wallet supports 2 distinct wallets.</p>

<ol>
<li><p>Vault wallet</p></li>
<li><p>Game wallet</p></li>
</ol>

<p>You can switch between wallets using the wallet selector in the upper-left 
corner of the XAYA Electron wallet.</p>

<p><img src="/images/img/xaya-wallet-selector.png" alt="xaya-wallet-selector" /></p>

<p>NOTE: The term &quot;wallet&quot; refers to several distinct things.</p>

<p>• The wallet software, e.g. XAYA Electron wallet, or XAYA QT wallet</p>

<p>• The individual wallets inside of the software, i.e. the vault wallet and game 
wallet. These are the wallet.dat files inside of the game.dat and vault.dat 
folders in the datadir (%APPDATA%\Xaya\, 
C:\Users\<user>\AppData\Roaming\Xaya, etc.).</p>
<h2 id='vault-wallet'>Vault Wallet</h2>
<p>Your vault wallet is designed to be encrypted. This is where you should store 
most of your CHI and valuable blockchain assets that you&#39;re not currently using.</p>

<p>Once you&#39;ve encrypted your wallet, you MUST back it up again. Your previous 
unencrypted wallets will not be sufficient.</p>

<p>See <a href="encrypt_vault_wallet.md">here for how to encrypt your vault wallet</a>.</p>

<p>You can back up your vault wallet on the <a href="settings.md">Settings screen</a>.</p>

<p>Further, you MUST store your password in a safe place. If you lose your 
password, you may lose your CHI and any assets that were stored in your vault 
wallet.</p>

<p>To reiterate, BACK UP YOUR WALLET AND STORE YOUR PASSWORD IN A SAFE PLACE.</p>
<h2 id='game-wallet'>Game Wallet</h2>
<p>Your game wallet should NOT be encrypted. Leaving it unencrypted makes it easier 
and faster to do moves in games. If it were encrypted, you&#39;d have to enter your 
password every time you made a move. This would be cumbersome, inconvenient, and 
could make some games effectively unplayable.</p>

<p>The game wallet is what you will be using most of the time.</p>

<p>You can back up your game wallet on the <a href="settings.md">Settings screen</a>.</p>
<h2 id='very-basic-security-tips'>Very Basic Security Tips</h2>
<p>The basic security advice here is basic, and not exhaustive. You may wish to use 
better security practices.</p>

<p>Never give anyone your wallet.dat file or password.</p>

<p>Physical security is important. Do not run XAYA wallet software on computers 
that other people have access to. If you must run the software on a computer 
that other people have access to, you run the risk of those people stealing your 
CHI and blockchain assets. Consider running a portable version of the wallet 
software from a portable SSD.</p>

<p>Consider using password management software. Remember to back up your password 
database and any other relevant data.</p>

<p>If you have a significant amount of CHI, avoid talking about how much you have. 
Practice good online security and don&#39;t give out personal information.</p>

<p>Use reputable anti-virus software and avoid installing questionable software. 
Also, be judicious in which websites you visit on any computer that you are 
running wallet software on.</p>

<p>Ultimately you and only you are responsible for your security. There is a great 
amount of information on computer security available online. It can even be fun.</p>
